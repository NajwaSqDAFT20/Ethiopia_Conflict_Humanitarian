# Conflict & Humanitarian Status Analysis- Ethiopia 

[Najwa Saqal]

[Data Analytics, Berlin & October 2020]


## Introduction:
Recently, on the 4th of November a conflict in Tigray region, Ethiopia has erupted. Thousands of individuals are displaced,  live in fears for their lives and have limited access to basics assistance, according to OCHA. Humanitarian actors on the ground have not had so far secure access to the affected-population, this makes the situation even harder leaving many people in need. 
For this project I am collaborating with Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) to develop an interactive dashboards for NRC internal staff. Programme teams could see where funding is coming from, Logistics / Security could see which NGOs are are already on the ground in case conflict further escalates and people have to be temporary housed or evacuated with together with another NGO. M&E team would be interested in the amount of IDPs are on the move, to scope the size of our response and see if we could support these groups alone or together with other NGOs or UN agencies


## Objectives:
* Creating an interactive dashboards where all information are found in one place and updated

## Datasets:
I am using 4 different datasets available publicly:
1. Conflict-related data for conflict analysis found on ACLED 
2. Internal Displaced Persons (IDP) surveys dataset provided by International Organisation for Migraion (IOM)
3. Dataset of donors published by OCHA
4. 3W (who, what, where) datasets published by OCHA

## Next steps:
* Due to time constraints, I could not analyse all of the 4 datasets. Next, will be running a deeper analysis
